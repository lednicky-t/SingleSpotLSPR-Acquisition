"""Shared app-wide undo/redo support, built on Qt's QUndoStack/QUndoCommand.

The whole app shares a single QUndoStack (owned by MainWindow, see
main_window.py's ``self.undo_stack``) so Ctrl+Z always undoes "the last thing
I changed," anywhere in the app - not a separate history per panel.

Every undoable action in this app is a snapshot: "the whole relevant piece of
state before" and "the whole relevant piece of state after," applied via a
single ``apply(value)`` callback. This is deliberately simpler than per-field
diffing - see SnapshotCommand's docstring for why.

    Most edits in this app (a plan-table cell, a paste, a row move, a settings
    field) ripple into more than just the one value the user touched - e.g.
    editing one step's duration recomputes every other step's start/end time.
    Snapshotting the whole relevant state (the plan's step list, a settings
    dataclass, ...) before and after is the only way to guarantee undo
    restores *exactly* the prior state, rather than a partial-field diff that
    could miss a ripple effect and leave things inconsistent. The snapshots
    involved are small (short lists of small dataclasses), so this costs
    nothing worth optimizing for.

    *apply* is called with a deep copy of *before* (on undo) or *after* (on
    redo), so the command owns its own copies independent of whatever the
    caller does with the original objects afterward.
