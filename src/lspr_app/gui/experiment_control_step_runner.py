"""Background task for applying a single pump-plan step to the hardware.

When the experiment control panel advances to a new step it fans out a batch
of device commands (flow rate, direction, valve, switch rotary valve port) on
a thread-pool thread so the GUI stays responsive.

Classes
-------
``_PlannedCommand``
    Single device command to execute: label, type, payload, description.
``_StepApplyResult``
    Result returned by the task: success flag, messages, mswitch refresh flag.
``_StepApplySignals``
    Qt signals for :class:`_StepApplyRunnable`.
``_StepApplyRunnable``
    ``QRunnable`` that sends the command batch and emits
    :attr:`_StepApplySignals.done` when finished.
